    Maakaf Community is an Israeli open-source community. We aim to encourage innovation, creativity, and addressing the existing issues in the development world today. Many developers rely on open-source code libraries to support the existing codebase, and some of the most commonly used libraries today are open-source libraries. We want to encourage and establish a community around these libraries, making it one of the most fertile developer communities in the country. We believe that contributing to open-source code can open the door to finding unexpected talents in the development world, which can help recruiters and leaders in various companies to find quality individuals and establish their qualities more quickly than the current recruitment process. We believe that there are talented individuals with a high motivation to learn in this community, and we are delighted to have your support.
